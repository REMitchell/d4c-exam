      "Our Time at South by South Lawn\n",
      "\n",
      "Only good days start with a 3:45am wake up time. Then a 4:15 Uber ride to the airport. Then an hour and a half plane ride, which happens to only be about a third full. Then an airport taxi to our destination, you know, The White House. But let’s back up here. Why exactly were we at the White House? We were there for South by South Lawn. Inspired by South by Southwest (which President Obama attended this past spring), SXSL brought together innovators, creators, and organizers working with social justice and environmental issues in an all-day festival showcasing their work. So, again, why were we there?\n",
      "Our involvement at SXSL was a collaboration of two labs on campus. Sara Hendren was invited to present her work with a+a at SXSL, and came to us folks in Return Design for exhibit design and fabrication help.  Return Design is Tim Ferguson Sauder’s lab at Olin where student designers produce commissioned work for people who help people, including non-profits and art organizations. That’s where we come in… We’re Keenan, Aaron, and Gaby, juniors and student designers at Return Design.\n",
      "At the White House gate, we were greeted by two of the SXSL organizers, as well as two Secret Service members, fully equipped with all of the tactical gear you can imagine. An adorable German shepard, most likely one command away from tearing out our windpipes, sniffed our equipment-filled bags. It turns out only Sara was on ‘the list.’ The two organizers were at the ready to tackle the situation, and quickly collected our IDs and added us to said ‘list’ via pink-cased smartphone—very official and secure.\n",
      "After around 20 minutes, the additions to the list had been processed and we were all let through the first gate. All except Keenan, that is, since his birth year was incorrectly entered as 2016. He may have a baby face, but that is a little extreme. So as the rest of the team entered the premises, Keenan had the unique opportunity to stand alone for another 20 minutes with the unflinching Secret Service men before he was reinstated to his rightful age and allowed on the lawn. The two organizers assured him and reminded him to “not lose faith in the government.” Not yet.\n",
      "Once we got in, we got right to work finalizing the booth and prepping for the press and attendees. Some kind folks from the coffee bar at the event brought us iced coffees to get us going, and soon the last of the vinyl was up, we (finally!) got a power hook-up, and we had the project prototypes arranged. \n",
      "“I hit something hard when I was putting in this stake. Is there a bunker under here?” – Jeff\n",
      "“I can neither confirm nor deny those allegations.” – the grinning Secret Service guy\n",
      "When the SXSL guests arrived, we found ourselves busily engaged in good conversation. Some attendees strolled by, while others were quick to be active in discussion with us. We were excited by how many people we somehow connected to the lab, through personal connections or otherwise. \n",
      "Although we had numerous interesting conversations with many interesting people over the course of the day, there were a few people who stood out. Adam Savage, with his film crew from Tested, stopped by and interviewed Sara. He was a super genuine guy, very engaged with the project, and was happy to take a photo with us afterwards. Valerie Jarrett, a senior advisor to President Obama, also stopped by with a large Secret Service member in tow. She was sweet and showed a nuanced interest in Sara’s work as well. Both NowThis and Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls dropped by the booth to film Sara talking about the project. The NowThis video, broadcasted live on Facebook, racked up over 100k views. Gaby got to talk to Bob Boilen, host of NPR’s All Songs Considered and the Tiny Desk Concert series, which was awesome. Bob was a cool guy, and even though he was very interested in the booth, we were unable to secure an invite to the next Tiny Desk Concert… Bummer.\n",
      "In addition to talking about our booth, we were able to see some of the other happenings at SXSL. The National Park Service booth was an interactive installation: a 14 foot diameter compass with a moveable needle. When the needle points toward a national park, the compass emits a joyful ding and displays information about all NPS-maintained land in that direction.\n",
      "While we did not get to hear many of the panel discussions (we were so busy at our booth!), we did get to see Congressman John Lewis and his powerful, emotional introduction to a panel. After the booths closed at sundown, we were able to catch the performance by The Lumineers. At one point the guitarist climbed up onto the 12-foot stack of speakers and played for a while before jumping off, guitar and all. (He was OK, don’t worry!)\n",
      "After a long, amazing day at South by South Lawn, we had a delicious picnic dinner and listened to the POTUS talk with Leonardo DiCaprio and Dr. Katharine Hayhoe about climate change. After, we lay down on blankets on the South Lawn to watch the premier of Leo’s film on climate change, Before The Flood. For those of us who had enough energy left to stay awake for the whole thing, it was an interesting film showing the destruction of climate change and calling for climate action.\n",
      "Our time at SXSL was an amazing experience. We were able to not only help design and fabricate a kick-ass booth, but we were also able to have interesting conversations with inspiring people and learn from some of the most impressive innovators, creators, and organizers.

      "Massachusetts held a special election this past June to fill the vacant Massachusetts senator position left by new Secretary of State John Kerry. Obama selected Kerry for the position after Hilary Clinton stepped down from her post at the end of January.\n",
      "This marks the second time in the past four years that a long-held senate seat was up for election. Ted Kennedy and John Kerry served as Massachusetts senators for 47 years and 28 years, respectively.\n",
      "Since Kennedy passed away in 2009, his senate seat has been well contested; he was followed briefly by interim senator Paul Kirk, then Scott Brown and finally Elizabeth Warren today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kerry’s ascension to Secretary of State meant that Massachusetts had an accelerated election cycle. The candidates started campaigning in January for the April primary. Ed Markey (Democrat) and Gabriel Gomez (Republican) were the chosen candidates for the June election; a third candidate from the Twelve Visions Party was also on the ballot.\n",
      "During these campaigns, Mo Cowan served as interim senator for Massachusetts just as Paul Kirk had for the late Kennedy.\n",
      "Massachusetts radio and TV stations created a lot of buzz around the June election. In the polls, Markey was beating Gomez only by a slim margin, unusual for such a left-leaning state. Democrats have particularly low turnout for non-major elections, which meant that both had a fighting chance of winning the elections.\n",
      "Voter turnout was just shy of 1.2 million, only a 27% turnout from the registered voters in Massachusetts.\n",
      "The results? Markey won with 54.8% of the vote, Gomez took home 44.8% and Richard Heos from Twelve Visions received 0.4%. Gomez may have lost, but he gained a high percent of the vote given that registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans three to one in Massachusetts (as of October 2012).\n",
      "Now that Markey has secured the position of senator, it will be interesting to see what he does over the next six years.\n",

      "So, you want to vote this November, but aren’t sure who to vote for? Here’s a guide to the positions each of the major candidates has taken on most of the important issues.\n",
      "Two disclaimers: These positions are taken from the candidates’ websites, and while there are other candidates, these are the important ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Economy: Both candidates want to increase US exports, in particular by signing free trade agreements. Obama has worked to make it easier to get patents, and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to watch over financial organizations more closely. This includes regulating the types of fees credit cards can charge consumers. Romney would repeal regulations from the Obama administration, and believes regulations should not cost companies anything and new ones should go through Congress. He would guarantee the secret ballot in votes to have unions and prohibit unions from spending money they get from automatic dues on political activity. He has proposed reorganizing federal retraining programs to minimize the number of agencies, encouraging private sector involvement in the programs, and giving states block grants – which have relatively few strings attached – for job retraining.\n",
      "Education: Both candidates believe education, on all levels, is necessary for success, and the current system needs reform. Romney believes federal student loans have helped drive up the cost of college, while Obama has expanded federal student loans. Obama has also regulated the student loan market heavily, and starting in 2014, new borrowers will only have to pay up to 10% of their disposable income, with forgiveness after 20 years, 10 if the person goes to work in public service, contingent upon all payments being on time. For K-12 education, Romney wants to give block grants to the states to encourage teacher quality, and make funding for schools move with low income and special needs students. Obama has implemented the “Race to the Top” program, which rewards states with money for making reforms. Romney wants to keep the testing requirements of No Child Left Behind but release test results to parents and the community instead of using them as a basis for government intervention. Obama has provided waivers to states for the No Child Left Behind requirements to encourage local solutions instead of forcing governmental takeovers.\n",
      "Environment: Romney favors long lead times before regulations come into effect, and wants to make it easier to develop the country’s resources by streamlining regulations. This streamlining would also apply to new, clean technologies and new nuclear reactor designs. He would approve pipelines for Canadian oil. He also supports amending the Clean Air Act to exclude carbon dioxide from its scope. Obama has issued new rules to reduce mercury and other air pollution, including raising the fuel economy of vehicles to an average of 54.5 by 2025. He has encouraged government investment in clean coal, biofuels, wind, solar, and nuclear energy, as well as promoting the development of natural gas and oil.\n",
      "Healthcare: Obama’s major accomplishment is the Affordable Care Act, known popuarly as Obamacare. Some of its provisions are as follows: allows people to stay on their parent’s healthcare until they’re 26, forces insurance companies to justify expense increases and pay for preventative care, removes lifetime caps on coverage, creates healthcare exchanges to make it easier for individuals to buy healthcare, outlaws discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, expands Medicare to make drugs more affordable and pay for some preventative care, and gives small businesses tax credits for buying insurance for their employees. Romney would waive the requirements of Obamacare and repeal it as soon as possible. In its place, he supports states creating their own healthcare systems, and would turn Medicaid into block grants, but would allow people to purchase insurance from any state. In addition, he favors limiting federal requirements for private insurers, instead rating the plans. Despite this, he still wants uninsured and high-risk people to have a chance at health insurance. He also would cap damages in medical malpractice suits and work to reduce the total number of suits.\n",
      "Immigration: The candidates agree that foreign students who study at American universities should have an easier path to citizenship, and illegal immigrants who serve in the military should be able to become citizens. Obama supports the DREAM Act, which would allow illegal immigrants in college who were brought to the country as children to become citizens, and has proposed allowing the undocumented family of citizens to apply for legal status inside the US. Romney believes they must apply for citizenship like anyone else – go back to their other country and wait. Romney opposes providing government services to illegal immigrants, such as in-state tuition and driver’s licenses, while Obama has moved the focus of federal enforcement away from low-priority cases, such as veterans, spouses of military personnel, and the elderly. Romney would like to increase visa caps for high-skilled workers and temporary worker visas, but implement a system to stop people overstaying their visas, and create a mandatory system for employers to check if their employees are legal. Obama opposes the Arizona law which allows state police to question people about their immigration status.\n",
      "LGBT issues: Obama supports gay marriage, while Romney opposes it, wanting to define marriage as one man, one woman. Obama supports appealing the Defense of Marriage Act, while Romney supports the act. Obama has also given hospital visitation rights to same-sex couples, and has expanded hate crime legislation to cover crimes motivated by gender or sexual orientation.\n",
      "Taxes: Obama supports raising taxes on those who make $250,000 or more a year to be equivalent to taxes on those who make less, particularly by closing loopholes such as the lower tax rate on capital gains. Romney opposes this, believing that current tax rates should be sufficient to sustain government. He supports lowering rates, arguing it will stimulate the economy. Specifically, he favors eliminating the “Death Tax” and the Alternative Minimum Tax. Both want to cut corporate taxes, with Obama specifically proposing lower taxes in exchange for bringing jobs back to the US and using more advanced manufacturing technologies.\n",
      "Women’s Rights: Obama passed and supports a law which forces “equal pay for equal work” between women and men, and Obamacare forces insurance companies to cover birth control. He has overturned a rule that banned federal aid for international aid groups that gave out information about abortion. However, he still supports policies that prevent federal dollars from being used to pay for abortions. Romney supports expanding this policy to force federal money to not have anything to do with abortions, including stopping funding for Planned Parenthood. This is because he believes life begins at conception, and that Roe v. Wade should be overturned.\n",

      "What may seem like a miniscule difference in positions to you can make a difference to millions of people when it’s played out over an entire country. While you may not care about, for instance, whether the federal or state government decides how Medicaid money is spent now, in fifty years when you’re eligible for Medicaid, you probably will care. And if you can make a difference, and decide not to, you really have no right to complain about the result.\n",
      "So what? Politicians never follow through on their campaign promises anyway.\n",
      "While a popular sentiment, politicians actually do tend to carry through on their campaign promises. Or try to, anyway. Our system of checks and balances makes it relatively hard for anyone to push their agenda through, but in general, campaign promises are broken because there was too much opposition to the idea, not because the politician didn’t try to follow through on their promise.\n",
      "I don’t know how to!\n",
      "I can help you there. College students are allowed to register either at their college or where they consider home. Every state is somewhat different in their requirements, which they generally list on their website. In general, you fill out a form, attach a copy of something that proves you live where you say you do, and mail it to the local election authority.\n",
      "If you can register to vote in two places, there are two important considerations:\n",
      "Absentee voting: If you register to vote in your home state, you probably won’t be able to get to the polls there on election day, and even if you register to vote here, it may be difficult to get to the polls. States vary widely in how restrictive they are about absentee or mail-in voting. In general, western states are more permissive. Massachusetts allows you to vote by mail if you will be absent from your city or town during normal polling hours.\n",
      "Competitiveness of the state: Contrary to “all men are created equal”, some votes really do count more than others. For instance, because of the electoral college, a vote in Florida is more likely to change the result of a presidential election than a vote in Massachusetts. A guide to help you decide:\n",
      "Battleground states are defined as states that have voted both Democratic and Republican within the last three elections. In general, these are the states that will decide who wins, and will get the most visits by the candidates, as well as have the most ad money spent in them. Massachusetts split 25% McCain, 75% Obama in the last election, so any state where the winner’s margin of victory was less than 25% of the vote is defined as more competitive than Massachusetts.\n",
      "Going down the ballot, thirty-three Senators are up for election this year. Not all the races are competitive, of course. However, it’s harder to quantify ‘competitive’ for senate elections, since they only happen every six years. Going back three elections for the Senate would put us back in 1994, a very different election.\n",
      "Of course, there are more elections this year than just for the Senate and the White House. Eleven governors will be chosen this year. All 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election, some of which are brand-new and many of which have to answer to voters for the first time. And, last but not least, there are innumerate local elections.\n",
      "Indeed, in several states, voters themselves – not just their representatives – can vote on the law. Space constraints preclude me from delving into these issues, but it’s safe to say that no matter where you register to vote, there will be something interesting and worthwhile for you to vote on. What are you waiting for?\n",

      "CHICAGO Former U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday makes his first major appearance since leaving office, having chosen Chicago, the city where his political career started, to emerge from a three-month hiatus from the public eye.Obama will meet youth leaders and promote community organizing near the same South Side neighborhoods where his own activism blossomed and propelled him to two terms in the White House that ended with Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who served as Obama’s first White House chief of staff, said that he was proud that Obama picked Chicago to make his last speech as president and the first in his post-presidency.“I think it reflects his emotional, as well as his intellectual, commitment to this city and seeing this city as his home,” he said.Obama's continued connection to Chicago is important to the city, which has global aspirations as well as a palpable insecurity about its place in the world.During the last year of Obama’s second term, Chicago laid claim to its share of his legacy by beating out Hawaii and New York as the site of his presidential library. \n",
      "Obama, who still owns a home in Chicago, was raised in Hawaii. The former president and his wife Michelle are expected to move from Washington to New York once their younger daughter, Sasha, graduates from high school.David Axelrod, a former top political adviser to Obama, said the decision to house the library in Chicago should have eased any concerns that its residents may have had about the former Democratic president's commitment to the city. But Monday's event, he said, is another important sign of the former president's strong links to Chicago.\n",
      "“He’s going to be more visible moving forward,” he said. “I think this is clearly a coming-out.”Reverend Michael Pfleger, a social justice activist who heads a large South Side Roman Catholic church, said a prominent Obama presence could help the nation’s third-largest city confront some of the thorny problems it faces. Chief among them is a spike in gun violence, an issue that  Trump has highlighted as a sign of lawlessness and the failure of the Democratic politicians who have long run Chicago.\n",
      "“It’s his life, and he’s not in elected office right now, so he can do what he wants,” Pfleger said. “But I’d love to see him engage in his home of Chicago. He could make a huge difference.”Civil Rights activist Jesse Jackson said Obama could use his powerful platform to address stark inequalities in Chicago schools, housing and employment, and to advocate for reinvestment in blighted neighborhoods.Monday's event takes place on the South Side campus of the University of Chicago, where Obama once taught constitutional law. It is intended “to encourage and support the next generation of leaders driven by strengthening communities,” according to a statement.Since leaving office, Obama has kept a relatively low public profile, taking vacations in Palm Springs, California and the British Virgin Islands, where he indulged in the sport of kite-boarding while vacationing with British billionaire Sir Richard Branson. Together with his wife, who grew up on Chicago’s South Side, the former president recently struck a two-book, $65 million memoir deal. He is expected to travel to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel next month. (Reporting by Chris Kenning; Editing by Mary Milliken)\n",

      "CHICAGO Barack Obama, making his first major appearance since leaving the White House, made no mention on Monday of his successor, Donald Trump, but urged young people to get more involved in their communities at a time of stark political divides.    “What’s been going on since I’ve been gone?” joked the former Democratic president as he moderated an event at the University of Chicago in the city where he began his political career and which will be the site of his presidential library.Obama, who once taught constitutional law at the school, recalled starting out as a young community organizer in the city and told a panel of six current and former students that he decided to focus his post-presidency on encouraging young people to engage with their communities.\"The single most important thing I can do is to help in any way prepare the next generation of leadership to take up the baton and to take their own crack at changing the world,\" he told an audience of several hundred people.\n",
      "Obama has largely stayed out of the public eye since leaving office in January despite efforts by Trump and the Republican-led Congress to undo much of his legacy, including on healthcare and the environment.Trump, a Republican, has said he \"inherited a mess\" and accused Obama in March, without providing evidence, of wiretapping his 2016 presidential campaign. Obama has denied the charge and FBI Director James Comey told a congressional hearing he had seen no evidence to support the allegation.Obama was not asked about Trump by the students and he took no questions from reporters. \n",
      "Saying it had long been his goal to bridge the country's deep political divide, Obama said: \"It’s harder and harder to find common ground because of the money in politics.\"\"Special interests dominate the debates in Washington in ways that don’t match up with what the broad majority of Americans feel,” he said. \n",
      "Obama added that changes in the way people use media allow them to converse just with those who agree with their own points of view.On Sunday, as part of a program to help at-risk young people, Obama met privately with men from Chicago's troubled South Side to discuss solutions for the violence and joblessness that have marked that neighborhood.The former president, who together with his wife, Michelle,  recently struck a two-book, $65 million memoir deal, is expected to travel to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel next month.

      "WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump accused predecessor Barack Obama on Saturday of wiretapping him during the late stages of the 2016 election campaign, but offered no evidence for an allegation which an Obama spokesman said was \"simply false\".Trump made the accusation in a series of early morning tweets just weeks into his administration and amid rising scrutiny of his campaign's ties to Russia.\"How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!,\" Trump wrote in one tweet. \"I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!\"The remarkable tussle between the current and former presidents just 45 days since the handover of power is the latest twist in a controversy over ties between Trump associates and Russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency.U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trump's favor. The Kremlin has denied the allegations.Trump has accused officials in Obama's administration of trying to discredit him with questions about Russia contacts.Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said it had been a \"cardinal rule\" of the Obama administration that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice.\"Neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false,\" Lewis said in a statement.The statement did not address the possibility that a wiretap of the Trump campaign could have been ordered by Justice Department officials.Trump said the alleged wiretapping took place in his Trump Tower office and apartment building in New York, but there was \"nothing found.\" The White House did not respond to a request to elaborate on Trump's accusations.\n",
      "AIDES CAUGHT BY SURPRISE\n",
      "Trump was spending the weekend at his Florida seaside resort, Mar-a-Lago. He was scheduled to meet with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly before a dinner with officials also including adviser Steve Bannon and White House Counsel Don McGahn, the White House said.Amid a political storm, Sessions on Thursday announced he would stay out of any probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election after it emerged he met last year with Russia's ambassador, although he maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose the meeting.A Trump spokeswoman said the president spent part of Saturday \"having meetings, making phone calls and hitting balls\" at his golf course in West Palm Beach.His supporters, meanwhile, staged small rallies in at least 28 of the country's 50 states, most of which passed off peacefully. But there were clashes in the famously left-leaning city of Berkeley, California, where protesters from both sides hit each other over the head with wooden sticks.Trump's tweets caught his aides by surprise, with one saying it was unclear what the president was referring to.\n",
      "Members of Congress said Trump's accusations require investigation or explanation.Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican, described the allegations as serious and said the public deserved more information. He said in a statement it was possible that Trump had been illegally tapped, but, if so, the president should explain what sort of tap it was and how he knew about it.U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called Trump's assertion a \"spectacularly reckless allegation\".\"If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nation's chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them,\" Schiff said in a statement.Former Obama adviser Ben Rhodes strongly denied Trump's allegations: \"No president can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you,\" Rhodes wrote on Twitter.\n",
      "RUSSIA SANCTIONS\n",
      "Trump's administration has come under pressure from Federal Bureau of Investigation and congressional investigations into contacts between some members of his campaign team and Russian officials during his campaign. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he had no knowledge of any wiretapping but was \"very worried\" about the suggestion Obama had acted illegally and would also be concerned \"if in fact the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity.\"Several other Republicans again urged an investigation into a series of intelligence-related leaks.Obama imposed sanctions on Russia and ordered Russian diplomats to leave the United States in December over the country's involvement in hacking political parties in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.Under U.S. law, a federal court would have to have found probable cause that the target of the surveillance is an \"agent of a foreign power\" in order to approve a warrant authorizing electronic surveillance of Trump Tower.Several conservative news outlets and commentators have made allegations in recent days about Trump being wiretapped during the campaign, without offering any evidence.Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned in February after revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office.  Flynn had promised Vice President Mike Pence he had not discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russians, but transcripts of intercepted communications, described by U.S. officials, showed that the subject had come up in conversations between him and the Russian ambassador.

      "CHICAGO Barack Obama, making his first major appearance since leaving the White House, made no mention on Monday of his successor, Donald Trump, but urged young people to get more involved in their communities at a time of stark political divides.    “What’s been going on since I’ve been gone?” joked the former Democratic president as he moderated an event at the University of Chicago in the city where he began his political career and which will be the site of his presidential library.Obama, who once taught constitutional law at the school, recalled starting out as a young community organizer in the city and told a panel of six current and former students that he decided to focus his post-presidency on encouraging young people to engage with their communities.\"The single most important thing I can do is to help in any way prepare the next generation of leadership to take up the baton and to take their own crack at changing the world,\" he told an audience of several hundred people.\n",
      "Obama has largely stayed out of the public eye since leaving office in January despite efforts by Trump and the Republican-led Congress to undo much of his legacy, including on healthcare and the environment.Trump, a Republican, has said he \"inherited a mess\" and accused Obama in March, without providing evidence, of wiretapping his 2016 presidential campaign. Obama has denied the charge and FBI Director James Comey told a congressional hearing he had seen no evidence to support the allegation.Obama was not asked about Trump by the students and he took no questions from reporters. \n",
      "Saying it had long been his goal to bridge the country's deep political divide, Obama said: \"It’s harder and harder to find common ground because of the money in politics.\"\"Special interests dominate the debates in Washington in ways that don’t match up with what the broad majority of Americans feel,” he said. \n",
      "Obama added that changes in the way people use media allow them to converse just with those who agree with their own points of view.On Sunday, as part of a program to help at-risk young people, Obama met privately with men from Chicago's troubled South Side to discuss solutions for the violence and joblessness that have marked that neighborhood.The former president, who together with his wife, Michelle,  recently struck a two-book, $65 million memoir deal, is expected to travel to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel next month.

      "WASHINGTON Facing intensifying election-year attacks over rising energy prices, President Barack Obama will seek on Thursday to shift the spotlight onto oil and gas companies by calling for the repeal of tax breaks that benefit the industry.Republicans are seeking to use the energy issue to deny the president a second term, and Obama plans to push back on that criticism during a trip to Republican White House candidate Mitt Romney's backyard of New Hampshire.Previewing Obama's speech in Nashua, a White House official said the president would emphasize there are no quick fixes for the pain at the pump.\"The president will make clear that while domestic oil and gas production has increased under his watch ... the solution to high gas prices requires more than increased drilling,\" the official said.The official also said Obama would \"reiterate his call to repeal the unwarranted $4 billion in annual subsidies handed out to oil and gas companies, and will urge Congress to take a vote on the repeal in the coming weeks.\"With the U.S. economy on the mend, rising gasoline prices are a threat to Obama's re-election on November 6, and Republicans have stepped up their attacks over his record on domestic energy exploration and TransCanada Corp's proposed Keystone XL crude oil pipeline.The average retail price of gasoline is $3.74-per-gallon, up from $3.39 a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association. The combination of rising political tensions in the oil-rich Middle East and the onset of the higher-demand U.S. summer driving season could push gasoline prices significantly higher in coming weeks.\n",
      "Obama rejected the Keystone XL pipeline, which was to run through environmentally sensitive areas of Nebraska from the U.S.-Canadian border.On Monday, the White House said it welcomed a fresh proposal by TransCanada to build a southern leg of the pipeline and refile an application for the northern part of the route.REGULATIONS ON ENERGY COMPANIES\n",
      "\n",
      "Republicans complain the president has hobbled domestic oil exploration and dismiss his administration's observation that U.S. oil output is at a record high, arguing this was thanks to the action of his Republican predecessor, George W Bush.\"The Obama administration continues to impose burdensome regulations on the domestic energy sector that will further drive up the cost of gasoline for the consumer,\" Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican, said on Wednesday.Obama has sought to put Republicans on the defensive by urging the U.S. Congress to repeal tax code provisions that benefit the oil and gas industries. Republicans counter that such changes should be weighed as part of a comprehensive rewrite of a complicated and inefficient tax code.Obama's visit to the Nashau Community College is his second trip in three months to the swing state, where Romney is expected to be a tough competitor if he wins the nomination to face Obama in November.\n",
      "Romney, a former governor of neighboring Massachusetts, owns a home on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. In January, Romney racked up a strong win in the Republican primary in New Hampshire, helping to give his campaign momentum.\"The primary results here indicate that Romney will give the president a fight in this purple state,\" said Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, who saw the economy as the big focus of the campaign, rather than social or cultural issues.Wins over Republican rival Rick Santorum in Michigan and Arizona on Tuesday helped Romney reassert his front-runner status.In New Hampshire, polls place Romney within range of Obama in a November match-up, even though the president carried the state in 2008. A still-sluggish recovery and historically high unemployment have weighed on Obama's support.\"Independents are the key. They went for Democrats in 2006-08, but shifted to the GOP (Republicans) in 2010,\" said Fowler, referring to the mid-term congressional elections in which Democrats sustained heavy losses.(Additional reporting by Caren Bohan; editing by Philip Barbara and Mohammad Zargham)\n",

The administration’s prediction that Russia’s intervention would fail or be ineffective has proven to be well wide of the mark. Moscow has no incentive to change course.

European governments are desperate to stem the flow of refugees and any such initiative must start with curbing Assad’s offensive, which is the main driver of the crisis. To do that, Europe needs leverage on Russia. \n",
      "Sanctions also have the crucial advantage of being politically acceptable to President Obama. He has repeatedly signaled that he will not authorize any military action that directly involves the United States in a war with Assad or his allies. But he has already backed sanctions on Russia, Iran, and other states. And leverage is a necessary component of an effective diplomatic strategy. Financial power is Obama’s tool of choice.

      "By all appearances, U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin don’t care much for each other. Putin reportedly has concluded he cannot work with Obama and will wait for a new U.S. president in 2017. Looking at the field of candidates, that would seem a major miscalculation — a miscalculation that Putin has made before.\n",
      "The relationship between the two got off to a bad start in 2009. On the eve of his first presidential visit to Moscow, Obama told the press that Putin “has one foot in the old ways of doing business.” At their meeting, then-Prime Minister Putin gave his guest a harangue about how the United States had mistreated Russia.\n",
      "Following the 2012 presidential elections in both countries, Washington did not envisage a new reset but still sought to do business with Putin. U.S. officials identified nuclear arms reductions, missile defense and expanding economic relations as key issues. However, in August 2013, the lack of progress on these questions prompted the White House to pull the plug on a planned September summit with Putin in Moscow.\n",
      "Relations slid downward more quickly after Russia annexed Crimea last year. The Obama-Putin relationship seems irretrievably broken. Has the Kremlin taken a hard look at the large and growing field running to succeed Obama? When it comes to foreign policy — and particularly when it comes to Russia — all serious candidates are running well to the right of the incumbent.\n",
      "Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, has played down her role in the reset and made clear her distaste for the Russian president. Her June 13 speech that kicked off her candidacy devoted little attention to foreign policy but nevertheless lumped Russia together with North Korea and Iran as “traditional threats.”\n",
      "There’s little love for the Russian president on the Republican side. Jeb Bush used the first stop of his June Europe tour to blast the Kremlin, calling Putin “a bully” and the Russian leadership “corrupt.”\n",

      "In 2000, as the echoes of the NATO military campaign against Serbia died down, missile defense became the most contentious issue on the agenda between Washington and Moscow. U.S. officials developed a limited missile defense plan that nevertheless went beyond the strict constraints in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. They therefore sought to amend the treaty to somewhat ease those constraints. They noted that defenses would remain limited such that they would pose no serious threat to the Russian strategic ballistic missile force. Russian negotiators, however, insisted on no changes to the treaty.\n",

      "As the Republican and Democratic parties convene in Cleveland and Philadelphia, we expect to see numerous signs of the deepening polarization that has dominated this campaign season. One issue that has traditionally shared bipartisan support is how the United States should approach the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, this year both parties have shifted their positions farther from the center and from past Democratic and Republican platforms. This swing impacts whether the Obama administration, which has devoted significant time and resources to the negotiations, will issue a parting statement on the conflict.\n",
      "In Cleveland last week the Republican party adopted a platform entirely dropping the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a move that puts the party further to the right than either AIPAC or Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The platform states, “We reject the false notion that Israel is an occupier and specifically recognize that the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement (BDS) is anti-Semitic in nature and seeks to destroy Israel.” This language, combined with Republican nominee Donald Trump’s apparent disinterest in the conflict, makes it unlikely a Trump administration would prioritize Israeli-Palestinian issues or make any serious attempt at negotiations.\t\n",

      "Conversely, this year’s Democratic Party platform reaffirmed the United States government’s long-standing commitment to seeking a two-state solution in the region. But the party took a notably progressive turn, highlighting both the importance of Israel’s Jewish and democratic future and Palestinian freedom “to govern themselves in their own viable state, in peace and dignity.” The contentious fight over the Democratic Party language, combined with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s (and her potential First Gentleman’s) passion for this issue reveals an intent by a future Clinton administration to reinvigorate negotiations.\n",
      "As President Obama and Secretary Kerry consider their final months in office, one item on the agenda is whether to push a last-ditch effort on the issue—either by releasing some sort of Obama or Kerry Parameters based on the outcome of the failed 2013-14 negotiations or by supporting one of the international initiatives such as the French Initiative, the Quartet Report, or the regional Arab Peace Initiative, now spearheaded by Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.\n",
      "Likely to drive the administration’s calculus are the Democratic and Republican nominees and their political motives on the U.S. led peace process. The time to watch for a potential move, therefore, is between November and January. Given the administration’s support for its own party’s nominee, it is in Obama’s interest to keep the peace process on life support—but without resuscitating it—through January. Publicly, but somewhat unenthusiastically, supporting the various international initiatives and allowing other states and international organizations to sit in the driver’s seat sets a future Democratic administration up with the best chance of success.\n",
      "Lessons from getting Israeli and Palestinian leaders to the table over the years include the wisdom to refrain from yelling about past progress in negotiations. Publicly revealing how far Netanyahu and Abbas were willing to go in 2014 would only harm the next administration’s efforts at resuming negotiations. Keeping the “Kerry Framework” in the administration’s pocket allows a Clinton administration to take ownership of the peace process should she be elected.\n",

      "Alternatively, if Trump is elected, the Obama administration would have nothing to lose in revealing the fruits of its efforts in 2013-14. The administration would have little concern for derailing a possible Trump attempt (which is not likely to take place in any event) and could determine that releasing some sort of Obama or Kerry Parameters would shed a positive light on the administration’s legacy. Furthermore, should the Republican Party win the White House, neither Obama nor Kerry is likely to care about the damage that releasing such a document might do to either Netanyahu or Abbas.\n",
      "The party conventions have solidified the deep divides—both between and within the parties—regarding the U.S. approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict this campaign season. This divide, combined with a renewed international focus on the conflict, virtually guarantees that the administration will keep the conflict on the back burner before November. The election, therefore, will not only determine our next president but also the fate of the “Obama/Kerry Parameters”.\n",

      "Winning hearts and minds can help fight violent extremism\n",
      "As President Obama finally buried the last remnants of the Cold War” in Havana, jihadi terrorists were unleashing suicide attacks against innocent civilians in the heart of Europe. What a powerful reminder that the old wars against communism are long behind us, replaced now by a much more insidious and unpredictable form of warfare, one that strikes terror in the hearts and minds of citizens, whether near or far removed from the latest carnage.\n",
      "This fear of the undetected radical in our midst is easy fodder for the overheated U.S. elections season. Leading candidates like Ted Cruz and Donald Trump fell over themselves to demand Obama’s return to Washington to “keep us safe,” as if our sprawling national security apparatus shuts down when Air Force One is out of town. Fortunately, the White House is long accustomed to walking and chewing gum at the same time.\n",
      "The real battle here is over symbols—of tough talk and bluster, on the one hand, and resilience and “steady hands” on the other, as candidate Hillary Clinton put it in her speech at Stanford University.\n",
      "Electoral posturing aside, there is a more serious message that our leaders are trying to convey when they react to another terrorist attack. “It’s very important for us not to respond with fear,” Obama said when asked why he did not abandon his historic trip to Cuba in light of Tuesday’s bombings. In addition to deploying drones, detectives and deadly strikes against these terrorist groups, he remarked, we need to demonstrate determination to maintain “our values of liberty and openness and the respect of all people.\n",
      "This is precisely the message Obama conveyed during his visit to our former enemy, Cuba, and our intermittent friend, Argentina. His remarkable speech to the Cuban people, visits with human rights defenders and entrepreneurs, and friendly gestures—such as doing the wave at a baseball game in Cuba and dancing the tango in Argentina—were powerful instruments to win over hearts and minds, not only in Cuba but around the world, about American intentions and values.\n",

      "Latin America should know. Its history is replete with internal conflicts driven by the despair of the deprived against the despotism of dictators and corrupt elites. The overlay of Cold War power struggles between the Soviet Union and the United States further fueled the flames of violence.\n",
      "Now, after decades of conflict, military rule and abject poverty, Latin America is an emerging region of economic growth and democratic stability. Colombia is close to settling the hemisphere’s longest armed conflict. Even socialist Cuba, which is struggling to enter the 21st century as neither friend nor foe of the United States, understands its future depends on a more open economy and better ties with all of its neighbors. Under the more pragmatic leadership of Raul Castro, it has abandoned the role of renegade in world affairs, renounced any support to international terrorism and pledged cooperation on law enforcement and anti-trafficking. It also has largely succeeded in delivering basic social services to its citizens, including free health care and education, while failing to protect fundamental political rights. In this latter area, it has some catching up to do with its neighbors.\n",

      "Meanwhile, the radicalization of disaffected youth in the Middle East is occurring in countries long known for their hardline authoritarian rule, suppression of women’s rights, silencing of free media, and coddling of religious fanaticism. The silent majority of Arab citizens, who long for greater freedoms and democracy, are once again marginalized as extremists battle over which armed group will wield the power of the state. Might they have something to learn from the story of democratization in Latin America, where radical terrorism is largely contained and citizens take their complaints peacefully to the voting booths or the streets?\n",
      "This history explains why so much is at stake in how the United States responds to perceived attacks against its way of life. Do we choose the path of surveilling Muslim communities, as Cruz suggests, or barring Muslims from our borders, as Trump avows? This, some say, is precisely what our enemies want, so they may recruit more disaffected followers to their diabolical cause. Or do we have the confidence in our own values of open competition of ideas, freedom of religion and rule of law to offer the world an alternative model for achieving both peace and security? Much depends on the outcome of our own democratic choices this November.\n",

I mean, we’ve got a whole bunch of individuals who have been tried who are currently in maximum security prisons around the country. Nothing’s happened to them. Justice has been served.

I understand that reaction. But we’re now over a decade out. We should be wiser. We should have more experience in how we prosecute terrorists.

But then he went into a riff about peace, and the necessity of peace, and the possibility of peace, and why peace has to be just, even saying; “Put yourself,” you Israelis, “in the shoes of the Palestinians,” and he talked over the heads of the leadership of Israel to say to them “you need to push your leaders, to take risks for peace”\n",

In a way, President Obama has been doing what President Sadat had done in the late 70’s. He came to Jerusalem before the actual negotiations with Mr.Begin in order to build support for the peace with Egypt at the time, and to enable Mr.Begin to make concessions and win public support. So he was investing public diplomacy in the same way trying to build support in the, or among, the Israeli public for the painful concessions that will have to be made.\n",

That was very good for Mr. Netanyahu, he relished it and he took advantage of it, but this was the first course. The second course is somewhat less tasty for the Prime minister.\n",

      "Obama’s Visit to Italy Quiet but Crucial\n",
      "\n",
      "Barack Obama’s meeting with Italy’s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi today is a side event in a Rome agenda dominated by the U.S. President’s more politically significant visit to Pope Francis at the Vatican. For Obama, the political expediency to show some common ground with the highly popular Francis, with whom he shares an interest in promoting the cause of fighting global poverty and inequality, is evident. This is not to say, however, that Obama and Renzi will only exchange diplomatic courtesies. \n",
      " \n",
      "For Renzi, it would be important to have Obama openly endorse his agenda to revive Italy’s economy. A blessing from the U.S. president, who is still very popular in Italy, would help Renzi build domestic support for his planned reforms of the labor market, the tax system, and government administration – all issues on which he faces significant opposition. The U.S. president has an interest in obliging, not least because Renzi aims to mitigate the German-championed austerity course the EU has been bent on for years. The U.S. administration has never favored the German approach as it is convinced that it has curbed Europe’s recovery, indirectly harming the U.S. economy. \n",
      " \n",
      "Obama, for his part, has his own priorities concerning Italy. He will remind Renzi of the imperative for Western allies to keep a firm line on Russia following the latter’s forced takeover of Crimea. The U.S. wants Italy to be ready to support restrictive measures that go beyond the modest set of sanctions already agreed at the EU level. This is a thorny question for Italy, which has extensive trade and energy relations with Moscow. One issue U.S. officials will look on with concern is whether Italy will remain committed to the development of South Stream, a gas pipeline under the Black Sea which is being developed by Russia’s Gazprom in cooperation with Italian energy company Eni. The planned pipeline has originated much controversy in the past because it bypasses Ukraine and runs counter to the EU-stated goal of reducing Europe’s reliance on Russia’s energy supplies. In light of the recent events in Crimea, it is safe to say that the U.S. expects Italy to put the project on hold – if not to scrap it altogether. \n",

      "The crisis with Russia could also give Obama the opportunity to call on Italy to avoid cuts to military spending that could further downgrade its defense capabilities. This is a tall order, however, as Renzi’s cabinet is actually debating a 3 billion euro reduction of defense expenditures. U.S. requests that the axe fall more on personnel costs (which absorb 66% of the defense budget), rather than equipment and investments, are likely to fall on deaf ears. Italy’s parliament has just approved a defense reform which does little to address this problem, and is unlikely to re-open the file anytime soon. \n",
      " \n",
      "Another issue on which the U.S. would like to see more Italian activity is Libya. The country is near total collapse. The political process has stalled (recent elections for a constitutional assembly have recorded a depressingly low turnout). Armed militias fight each other for controlling portions of the territory – one of them even managed to snatch an oil tanker from the government and bring it into international waters, where it was seized by U.S. Special Forces and given back to Tripoli. Illicit trafficking is rampant. An authoritarian turn or, worse, a new civil war, are concrete possibilities. As Italy has huge energy and security interests at stake in Libya, it is only natural to the U.S. that Rome should take on greater responsibilities in the region. Renzi should profit from U.S. backing and make a sustained effort to mobilize international resources to help Libya’s government to accelerate the democratic transition, train its security forces and restart the economy. \n",

      "A further issue on the U.S.-Italian agenda is Iran. Under the previous government, Italy’s overtures towards the Islamic Republic raised eyebrows in Washington. U.S. officials worried that the flurry of Italian-Iranian exchanges – between cabinet members, lawmakers and businessmen – could lead to a premature erosion of the Iran sanctions coalition. While U.S. concerns were exaggerated, the Renzi government has not shown the same level of activism and may never do so. Renzi has little foreign policy experience but is a shrewd politician. He could be unwilling to further irritate Washington by authorizing further overtures toward Iran because he knows that the crisis in Western-Russian relations has the potential to strain U.S.-Italian relations. \n",

      "The decision to keep fifty thousand troops into 2011 was based on guidance from General Raymond Odierno, who commanded American forces in Iraq; from General David Petraeus, who had led the surge until September 2008, when he returned home to run U.S. Central Command; and from Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. It also built on the accord negotiated by Bush and Maliki in late 2008 that directed U.S. forces to leave Iraq’s cities by June 2009 and leave the country altogether by December 2011. \n",
      " \n",
      "By modifying the plans in this way, Obama could avoid any big drawdowns of U.S. troops in Iraq in the unsettled year of 2009, when Iraqis would be taking his measure, and when American troops would be pulling out of Iraqi cities and thereby conferring far more responsibility on the Iraqi army and police. This was too fraught a time to test the stability of Iraq by launching into a predetermined exodus. With Obama’s new plan, U.S. troop numbers could stay robust through the crucial Iraqi elections of March 2010—the second real election in that young democracy, a delicate moment in any country that has recently thrown off the yoke of dictatorship and adopted representative government. \n",

      "There was some good diplomacy in this time as well, largely spearheaded by Vice President Biden. During the winter of 2010, Prime Minister Maliki seemed intent on exploiting gray areas—and even some not-so-gray areas—in Iraqi election law to ensure he would hold onto power. Biden did much to get him to desist from further electoral shenanigans. Partial recounts in districts where other parties besides Maliki’s had done well were, it was agreed, not a good idea. Banning former members of Saddam’s Baathist Party from holding office after they had won seats was without legal foundation. To drive home such points, the vice president could count on his boss’s backing when necessary. As Biden put it to me, “When I need the big man to make a phone call to an Iraqi politician to make a point, he’s happy to do so too.” \n",

      "The progress represented by the surge, the Sunni awakening, the Basra and Sadr City offensives, and related developments in the latter Bush years was solidified during Obama’s tenure. The Iraqi civil war as such is over. Violence is down more than 90 percent relative to 2006 and early 2007 levels. Electricity production is up more than 50 percent, and international energy firms are bidding enthusiastically to help develop new oil fields. The central government is sharing revenues, and responsibilities, with Iraq’s eighteen provinces—even those dominated by Sunni and Kurdish communities. Politics are still rough and tumble, and the future remains uncertain. But debate, parliamentary maneuver and horse-trading, rather than violence and threats, have become the means of trying to resolve differences in Iraq. \n",
      " \n",
      "The Obama administration’s work is not done on Iraq, of course. Prime Minister Maliki is showing autocratic tendencies, and violence continues at tragic if much-reduced levels. In this environment, the complete departure of U.S. forces last year was regrettable. They formerly helped man checkpoints, carried out joint patrols with Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and otherwise helped calm nerves and provide reassurance among still-jittery Iraqis as the wounds of civil war began to heal. It is a different situation with them gone. \n",

      "To what extent was their departure inevitable? Could Obama have done more to improve the odds of striking an acceptable deal with the Iraqi government that would have kept, say, five thousand to twenty thousand U.S. troops in Iraq for an additional period of time, perhaps up to several years? It is difficult to say. The Obama administration could not force the issue, as Secretary Gates realized in noting late in 2010 that the United States would be open to reconsidering the departure deadline, but only if Iraqis made the first move. It was at Maliki’s insistence that the 2008 accord mandating this scheduled departure was reached, and it was the Bush administration, not the current U.S. government, that signed the bilateral deal. Domestic Iraqi politics still contain a healthy dose of anti-Americanism, and Iraqis remain a proud people who want to run their own country. \n",
      " \n",
      "There have been reports that the Obama administration signaled to Iraqis that it wanted any enduring American role to be quite modest—perhaps scaring away Iraqi leaders who would have been willing to lobby hard for a continuing U.S. military presence but only one large enough to make a major difference. This fact may have contributed to the ultimate impasse in negotiations and thus the complete departure of American units from the country. If such reports are true, the Obama administration elected to take a gamble that perhaps was not necessary. \n",
      " \n",
      "But the United States gave Iraq eight and a half years of military support, including nearly three on Obama’s watch, when he had promised only sixteen months before being elected. In the end, even if Washington’s interest in staying engaged was known to be only lukewarm, it was the Iraqis and their new democratic government that insisted on no legal immunity for American troops on Iraqi soil, which everyone knew in advance would be unacceptable to the United States. \n",
      " \n",
      "Iraqis made the crucial decision for American troops to go. It was their right. And it is useful for the United States to prove to the Middle East and the world that, when asked to leave, we do in fact leave. That counters many myths about our supposedly imperial intent and discourages countries from taking our presence and our help for granted. On balance, this outcome is a reasonable gamble on the part of Baghdad and Washington. Obama’s record to date on Iraq may not be Churchillian and may not be his proudest achievement, but it is a solid and sober one. \n",

      "• Big wars. Conventional wisdom now depicts Obama as a steely killer, deploying drones and computer viruses against America’s foes from Iran to Pakistan to Yemen, and using commandos to take down Osama bin Laden. This is part of the story, but Obama has also been a pragmatist, rejecting either reflexive dovishness or hawkishness. He promised to get out of Iraq in a little more than a year. He did get out, but took three. After nearly tripling combat forces in Afghanistan, Obama set deadlines for starting to bring those troops home, contrasting the prospect for peace with hawkish escalation. He has been cerebral and non-ideological — though it is not clear whether he will be successful.\n",

      "• Peace efforts. On the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, a high priority from Day One, Obama has made his biggest mistakes. He issued demands to the Israelis that were perhaps unrealistic. When he relented, his indecision made it more difficult for both sides to negotiate. One year he raised hopes of a new Palestinian state at the United Nations, yet came back 12 months later threatening a U.S. veto on any U.N. action that would have sought to achieve exactly that. And his plan to pursue détente with dictators — never to negotiate out of fear but not to fear to negotiate, as Obama has paraphrased John F. Kennedy— produced no breakthroughs with Iran or North Korea, Cuba or Venezuela (though it achieved a lesser success more recently with Burma, also known as Myanmar).\n",

When North Korea and Iran slapped Obama’s outstretched hand, rebuffing his attempts at engagement, he led international sanctions that punished both of them more severely than George W.

He succeeded in uniting the international community against them even if he has yet to persuade any rogue states to change course.\n",

      "• Rising powers. China met Obama’s 2009 efforts to allow the nation a greater role on the world stage with some degree of distrust and even hostility. But as China became more assertive, Obama bounced back. In a classic display of realpolitik that might have met with approval from President George H.W. Bush, Obama refocused American military strength and diplomatic efforts on Asia, the region of greatest promise for the United States in the 21st century. Our alliances in that region have been reinvigorated, and China has been reminded that the U.S. remains a Pacific power.\n",
      " \n",
      "• Smaller wars. Beyond Iraq, Afghanistan and al-Qaeda, Obama has wrestled with a number of smaller conflicts — more than the typical American president has needed to do — with mixed results. Libya appears, on balance, to have been a success; Sudan split into two semi-peacefully (so far at least); and Somalia seems a little better than before. But violence in Mexico has gotten worse on Obama’s watch, and conflict zones in Africa from Congo to Mali to Nigeria are unimproved.\n",

But the descent into chaos in Syria, and the potential for things to fall apart in Egypt, are threatening American interests in regional stability at a time when election demands are distracting Obama. It could turn out quite badly in the end.\n",

He vowed to repair the breach with the Muslim world, move toward a nuclear-free planet, arrest climate change and dramatically lessen global poverty.\n",

Perhaps no great harm has been done, except that cynicism and disappointment have replaced hope, especially in the Muslim world.\n",

On balance, Obama has done a good job protecting the nation’s interests — with a respectable record on the wars and counterterrorism, on handling China’s rise, on working with reformists during the Arab awakenings, on “resetting relations” with Russia and repairing them with numerous European allies, and on squeezing the rogue states.

      "There is certainly plenty for Mitt Romney and Obama to debate. In terms of ongoing crises, Syria and Iran loom large between now and Election Day. In terms of how history will remember Obama, or his successor, there is another crucial matter that is too often forgotten in foreign policy discussions — national economic recovery. Without a strong economy, America’s decline will happen whether we like it and admit it or not. Four straight years of trillion-dollar deficits, even if not primarily Obama’s fault, leave the country weaker than when he stepped into the Oval Office. Whoever sits in the Oval Office come Jan. 20, Obama’s foreign policy successes will matter little if the economy ultimately can’t support American power.\n",

      "Today in Cleveland, President Obama jettisoned the theme of economic inequality that had suffused his economic speeches for more than six months, focusing instead on “how we grow faster, how we create more jobs, and how we pay down our debt.” The real issue, he said, is how we reverse the “erosion of middle-class jobs and middle-class incomes.”\n",
      "In making that claim, Obama doubled down on the guiding assumption of his campaign—that he can turn the 2012 election into a choice between two models for the future, rather than a referendum on his first term. He made only a brief effort to defend his economic record, focusing instead on what he intends to do in a second term and on what he believes are the fatal flaws of the Republican/Romney agenda.\n",
      "His argument for reelection is simple: Mitt Romney would take us back to the economic program that failed us under George W. Bush. The alternative, he said, is a strong and growing economy built on a strong and growing middle class—a twenty-first century economy built on a foundation of education, science and innovation, infrastructure, and clean energy, and paid for with a “balanced” program of deficit reduction that asks the wealthiest American to pay “a little bit more.”\n",
      "All this invites an obvious retort: if that’s the right plan, why didn’t you implement it during your first term? Obama’s answer: the Republicans in Congress wouldn’t let me. And in November the American people should seize their chance to break this “stalemate.”\n",
      "I’ve long argued that when presidents seek reelection, their record will be the focus of the campaign whether they like it or not. My critics suggest there is a real alternative—but is that really so? When Obama asks why we would return to the policies that failed us, he’s channeling the tag-line of one of the most effective political ads of all time, Ronald Reagan’s “Morning in America”: “Why would we ever want to return to where we were?”\n",
      "But I invite my older readers to take another look at the ad, and my young readers to look at it for the first time. You’ll find that most of it is a summary of how well things are going under Reagan’s stewardship. The concluding rhetorical question gains its force from the contrast between the optimistic experience of the present and the bitter memory of the past. The point isn’t that it was dark before, but that it’s morning now. Unlike Reagan, Obama can’t make that claim. \n",
      "But it doesn’t matter what I think. The president and his top political advisors clearly reject the view that his record is central and believe they can make this election into a choice between two futures. As a Democrat, I hope they’re right. But as a student of American politics, I fear they’re not. \n",

      "Obama’s Executive Orders; A Reality Check\n",
      "\n",
      "President Obama’s State of the Union Address has drawn greater attention to executive orders. Executive orders are a common presidential tool that gives guidance to the executive branch on how to “faithfully execute the laws” or rely on discretion within existing law to affect policy.\n",
      "Republican opposition has surrounded the president’s declaration that he will begin relying on executive orders to move in areas where Congress has stalled. Claims of tyranny, overstepping authority, and unlawfulness have been batted around by frustrated Republicans. However over the years, executive orders have often been criticized by Congress, particularly members of the party opposite the president. Executive orders ruffle feathers over policy, increase partisanship, and provoke separation of powers issues, but in reality presidents have substantial authority to issue such orders. When the controversy over an issue gets intense it can end up in the Courts but this is rare.  Courts have largely upheld the power, and in fact, Congress sometimes adopts the policy through legislation (see the creation of the Peace Corps, for example).\n",
      "So, what about the criticisms of Obama abusing the powers of his office or using executive orders in an unprecedented way? It’s largely grandstanding from the right.\n",
      "The graphic below shows the frequency with which presidents have issued executive orders. Republicans are right: President Obama is absolutely unique…in how infrequently he issues them! The last president to issue executive orders at such a slow rate was Grover Cleveland who served from 1885-1889 & 1893-1897. What’s more, Republican complaints about President Obama’s use of such powers is a bit ironic, given historically Republican presidents use executive orders more frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few important takeaways from this chart:\n",
      "\n",
      "Executive orders are fairly common.\n",
      "Their use has dropped over the 20th century.\n",
      "So far Obama has used executive orders less than other contemporary presidents.\n",

Criticism of president-as-dictator are always overblown, as the other branches of government serve as checks on presidential power, and those checks extend to executive orders.\n",
      "However, while the above chart is useful and informative, it is important to note a few items that it does not tell us—items that can inform the discussion.\n",
      "First, not all executive orders are created equal. Some are quite forceful, making dramatic changes to policy. Others are more routine, housekeeping issues. To say that one president issued more executive orders than another, tells us little about the scope of those orders or the impact they have on policy.\n",

      "Second, executive orders are just one type of executive power and do not necessarily reflect the true might of the president. Presidents can issue signing statements, presidential memoranda, presidential proclamations, engage in rulemaking (regulatory) authority, reassign appointees, influence budgeting decisions, and use a host of other means of influencing outcomes.\n",

      "WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate on Monday confirmed former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue as secretary of agriculture, leaving all but one of President Donald Trump's Cabinet positions filled. Lawmakers voted 87 to 11 in favor of Perdue, who takes office as the agricultural community grapples with the key issues of trade and immigration.The nomination earlier passed the Senate Agriculture Committee with only one vote in opposition, although some Midwestern senators raised concerns that Perdue was not from a major agricultural production state.\n",
      "Trump nominated Perdue, 70, in January but progress on his confirmation was slow, with media reports suggesting that undoing his various business entanglements caused delays in the ethics filings. Perdue did not file his disclosure forms until mid-March, and the Senate panel backed him later that month.\n",
      "Trade is seen as critical to reviving a moribund farm economy, where incomes have been falling with lower grain prices. Farm incomes in 2016 are expected to have hit their lowest levels since 2009.\n",
      "Agriculture relies heavily on seasonal and casual labor, and farmers are concerned tough immigration rules could make it harder to find workers while raising costs. Trump has raised tensions on immigration with his pledge to build a wall at the Mexican-U.S. border. Perdue, who holds a doctorate in veterinary medicine and was raised on a dairy farm, is the first agriculture secretary from a southern state since Mike Espy of Mississippi, who served from January 1993 to December 1994. Perdue's home state of Georgia accounted for just 2 percent of total U.S. agriculture exports in 2015.Trump still has one Cabinet nominee, Alexander Acosta for labor secretary, awaiting confirmation.

      "LONDON U.S. President Donald Trump is \"absolutely not\" trying to talk down the strength of the dollar, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was quoted as saying in the Financial Times on Wednesday.Trump said last week in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that the dollar was \"getting too strong\", and backed away from labelling China a currency manipulator.Mnuchin had played down that comment on the dollar in an interview first published late on Monday in the FT. In a more detailed version published on Wednesday, he directly rejected the idea that Trump was trying to talk down the dollar, saying \"Absolutely not, absolutely not.\"\n",
      "The dollar gained after Mnuchin's initial remarks late on Monday.

Finance ministers and central bank chiefs meet in Washington this week for the International Monetary Fund's twice-yearly meetings.

      "\n",
      "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Tens of thousands of people marched through midtown Manhattan and dozens of U.S. cities on Saturday to demand that President Donald Trump release his tax returns and to dispute his claim that the public does not care about the issue.Organizers of \"Tax March\" in more than 150 cities across the country and beyond wanted to call attention to Trump's refusal to disclose his tax history, as his White House predecessors have done for more than 40 years. The marches coincide with the traditional April 15 deadline for U.S. federal tax returns, though the filing date was pushed backed two days this year.There were no reports of violence or arrests, in contrast to a clash between Trump supporters and opponents that erupted at a rally in Berkeley, California, where nine people were arrested.Two of the biggest tax marches took place in New York and Los Angeles, with each drawing about 5,000 people, according to estimates by Reuters reporters. No official estimates were immediately available. In Manhattan, a good-natured crowd rallied at Bryant Park before marching up Sixth Avenue to Central Park.Among the marchers was an oversized inflatable rooster, sporting an angry expression and a sweeping metallic orange hairdo meant to resemble Trump's signature style.“Thanks to Trump, I think that releasing your taxes when you run for president now has to be a law,” said New Yorker Marni Halasa, 51, who arrived in a tutu and leggings made of fake dollar bills and holding a sign that read “Show Me The Money!”\n",
      "In Washington, more than 1,500 protesters gathered on the front lawn of the U.S. Capitol, where members of Congress addressed the crowd before it marched to the Lincoln Memorial. \"We are taking the gloves off to say knock off the secrecy Mr. President,\" said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which would play a leading role in tax reform measures being considered in Congress.He described Trump's refusal to release his taxes as being \"like a teenager trying to hide a lousy report card.\"TAX REFORM\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the marchers was Melinda Colwell, 34, a stay-at-home-mother from Ledyard, Connecticut. She said she was concerned that conflicts of interest in Trump's tax returns might foreshadow selfish interests in his tax reform policies.\"I think it's important to know how that could influence his decisions and how he could benefit from the decisions being made,\" she said.As a candidate and as president, Trump has refused to release his tax returns, citing an ongoing audit by the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS has said that Trump can release his tax returns even while under audit.The White House could not be reached immediately for comment on the marches.\n",
      "Events were also planned in cities in Europe, Japan and New Zealand.The marches were launched by a single tweet, organizers said. A day after the massive Jan. 21 women's march in Washington and other cities, comedy writer Frank Lesser tapped out on Twitter, \"Trump claims no one cares about his taxes. The next mass protest should be on Tax Day to prove him wrong.\" It has been retweeted more than 21,000 times.    In Los Angeles, television director Mike Stutz turned up at the march dressed in costume as a Russian general and said he was called General Bullshitski. He carried a sign that read: \"What Tax Returns? Putin paid cash. Trust your oligarchs,\" referring to allegations of contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia, led by President Vladimir Putin.Joe Dinkin, spokesman for the Working Families Party, one of the groups organizing the marches, said investigations into the Trump campaign's alleged connections to Russia underscore the need to disclose his returns.\"Without seeing his taxes, we'll never really know who he's working for,\" said Dinkin, who expects the marches to draw at least 100,000 protesters.There have been some glimpses into Trump's tax history. Last month, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow reported on two pages of Trump's 2005 return that were obtained by investigative reporter David Cay Johnston and released by DCReport.org. They showed Trump paid $38 million in taxes on more than $150 million in income. And in October, The New York Times reported that Trump had declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 federal tax return, citing three pages of documents from the return.

      "WASHINGTON In the end, the Closer couldn’t close the deal.For President Donald Trump, the collapse on Friday of his first legislative priority, a healthcare reform bill, was an embarrassing loss of face after he and his administration insisted up until the time of the vote by the U.S. House of Representatives that there was enough Republican support.It brings into question the neophyte president’s ability to move big-ticket legislation through Congress. And for a celebrity businessman who brands himself a deal-maker and fixer, it casts doubt over his ability to deliver on his bold \"drain-the-swamp\" promises to shake up Washington.The White House wants to advance, among other things, tax reform and a massive infrastructure package this year, but now it must address whether a change of approach is needed and whether congressional allies such as House Speaker Paul Ryan can be counted on to deliver.\"This is the most consequential day of Trump's presidency and it's not just a failure, it's a stunning failure,” Charlie Sykes, an influential Wisconsin Republican political commentator and frequent Trump critic, said on Twitter. Trump appeared to chalk up the loss in part to his own inexperience after House leaders pulled their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare following defections by both moderate and far-right Republican members who were unmoved by Trump's ultimatum to vote for the plan or live with the current system.“We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process,” Trump said after the bill was withdrawn, adding that he would move forward with other priorities.It was yet another setback for an administration barely two months in office that has already seen its national security adviser resign, had its immigration restrictions struck down in courts, and faces a barrage of questions about the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.Trump’s hallmark salesmanship seemed to abandon him this week. Although he furiously courted the hard-line conservatives opposed to the reform bill, they largely refused to yield, and in the process he alienated moderates who initially supported the bill.The president then switched tactics and gave up trying to bring the conservative opponents into the fold, instead delivering an ultimatum that all Republicans needed to back the bill. That did not work either. \n",
      "Trump also failed to persuade the American public that the bill was an improvement over the one it would have repealed and replaced: the Affordable Care Act - the signature domestic achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama. Polls showed the replacement bill to be deeply unpopular, and conservative Republicans complained that their offices were being deluged by calls from constituents opposing it. “This demonstrates that campaigning and legislating are two different things,” said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Representative Joe Barton of Texas blamed the failure on Republicans who control the White House, Senate and the House still learning how to govern after eight years of Obama. \"Sometimes you’re playing fantasy football and sometimes you’re in the real game,” Barton told Reuters.Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida called it “a big blow\" for the Republican agenda.Trump’s efforts to engage the bill’s opponents at times seemed to muddy the process further, as he largely cut Ryan out of negotiations. (Ryan didn't seem to mind, calling Trump a \"great closer.\") \n",
      "But even as Trump offered concessions, conservatives did not budge and moderates were angered.Stuart Diamond, a professor who teaches negotiation at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said Trump’s strong-arm tactics backfired. “Threats don't work in general,” he said. “They cause damage to relationships. They definitely don't work in a situation with a lot of different stakeholders, where the power is distributed.”ESCAPING A LOOMING DISASTER    \n",
      "After the bill was revised along Trump’s specifications, the Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the financial impact of proposed legislation, determined that the bill would deprive 24 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade and slice about $150 billion off the budget deficit. \n",
      "The CBO said the bill would not affect the number of uninsured but it would reduce the budget deficit significantly less than the original bill, troubling fiscal hawks. Even as Trump and the White House pushed harder, opposition to the bill among the rank and file rose.Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who is also a small-business owner, said Trump was still getting used to governing. “There are parallels between government and business, but they are not exactly the same.”The lesson from the debacle, said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who was an aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, is that the White House needs to take a firmer hand in crafting legislative strategy. On healthcare, Trump largely deferred to Ryan’s office, which drafted the bill in secret, sowing mistrust among conservatives. Congress now faces arguably an even tougher legislative reform: overhauling the tax code, which has not been done since 1986 and involves navigating a snake pit of competing special interests. Like Trump's healthcare proposal, it could struggle against public opinion, with Democrats likely to cast it as a Republican giveaway to the rich.There was also a feeling among some Republicans that they had escaped a looming disaster. Even if the bill had passed the House, it faced a radical overhaul in the Senate, meaning both chambers would have been tied up battling over the bill for weeks, perhaps months.And if it became law and millions of voters lost health insurance, some Republicans feared they could suffer at the polls. Instead, those Republicans have to hope voters will not punish them for failing to deliver on a promise they had been making since Obamacare was passed in 2010, and that they will  still believe this president when he says he can strike a deal.“This is a promise the GOP made to voters. They need to get it right,” said Rachel Bovard, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, as she urged Republicans to \"start over.\"It is unclear when that could happen. \"This bill is dead,” said Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, a member of the House leadership team.

      "NEW YORK A nonprofit watchdog expanded a lawsuit accusing U.S. President Donald Trump of violating the Constitution by letting his hotels and restaurants accept payments from foreign governments.The amended complaint filed on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan adds a restaurant trade group, whose members include nationally known chefs Tom Colicchio and Alice Waters, and a hotel events booker in Washington, D.C. as plaintiffs.It is intended to address concern over whether the watchdog, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, was itself harmed by Trump and had standing to sue at all.Trump is expected to respond by April 21, and had said the original lawsuit filed on Jan. 23 had no merit.Spokesmen for the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.\n",
      "The amended complaint said Trump violates the Constitution's \"emoluments\" clause, which bars him from accepting various gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval, by maintaining ownership over his business empire despite ceding day-to-day control to his sons, Eric and Donald Jr.It said members of Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United Inc, which represents more than 200 restaurants and nearly 25,000 workers, have improperly lost business, wages and tips to Trump's competing businesses.Jill Phaneuf, the other new plaintiff, works for a hospitality company that books events in hotels near Washington's \"Embassy Row,\" which house foreign diplomats, and claimed that Trump is costing her commissions.\n",
      "The complaint said such plaintiffs are injured when foreign governments try to \"curry favor\" with Trump by favoring his businesses.It said this has even occurred since Trump took office, when China granted him trademark rights after he pledged to honor the \"One China\" policy of his White House predecessors.\n",
      "\"When asked why defendant changed his position on the One China policy, and whether he had gotten something in exchange from China, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer answered: 'The President always gets something,'\" the complaint said. (here)U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams, an appointee of former Democratic President Barack Obama, oversees the litigation.The lawsuit seeks to \"uphold one of the most basic aspects of the rule of law: no one, including the president, is above the law,\" Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California at Irvine's law school and one of the plaintiffs' lawyers, said in a statement.The case is Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington et al v. Trump, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-00458. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Andrea Ricci)\n",

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s confirmation hearing advice that we should stay in the regime and keep a seat at the table is clearly right.\t\n",

Of course, the Agreement is built to encourage ambition—otherwise, there would be no point—but it does this in a non-intrusive way that allows countries to set their own path.  We advocated this approach because we knew it was crucial both to ensuring support at home and to securing the participation of countries around the world, including key emerging economies like China and India.\n",

      "Second, the range of support in our country for the Paris Agreement and for strong, sensible action to contain climate change is deep and wide, a far cry from the old days, 20 years ago, when the flawed Kyoto Protocol was at issue. For example, the Senate’s leading foreign policy authority, Republican Chairman Bob Corker of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has counseled against withdrawal, recognizing the flexible nature of the Paris accord.  Large and influential swaths of American business, including companies like DuPont, United Technologies, ExxonMobil, General Mills, Hewlett Packard, Nike, Siemens, PG&E, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and hundreds of others, have made clear their support for the Paris Agreement and climate action.  And institutions from Citibank to Goldman Sachs, Blackrock and Shell Oil, among others, have produced serious research on the actions that need to be taken and can be taken affordably to meet the Paris climate goals.\n",
      "Moreover, there is no logic in withdrawing from Paris even for the dwindling cadre of climate skeptics. What skeptics assert, after all, is that the very widely accepted conclusion that climate change is real, is happening and is dangerous might be wrong. But even by this counter-factual view of science, facts and evidence, it is still obviously true that the widely-accepted conclusion about climate change and its dangers might well be right. And if it is, and we have elected to ignore it, not even bothering with an insurance policy, what then? We have never before ignored a risk of this magnitude to our well-being, our economy and our national security in any other context.  The Pentagon itself has powerfully articulated the imperative of addressing the climate threat: “The pressures caused by climate change…are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions – conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.”\n",

      "Finally, walking away from Paris would be an act of reckless disregard for U.S. standing in the world. Should the White House take this step, countries around the world will feel betrayed, and will react with a mix of rage and deep disappointment. The vast majority of them view climate change as a real, even existential threat. They are keenly aware that it took a monumental effort to reach the accord in Paris, where the rules of engagement require the consensus of more than 190 countries with a range of different needs and perspectives. They know that 23 years after the original Framework Convention on Climate Change was agreed to in Rio, we finally established an ambitious, universal, flexible, nationally determined regime that makes it possible to meet the climate threat. And they will conclude that a U.S. rejection of Paris represents not just a national decision to pull back, but a deeply irresponsible effort to cripple the world’s capacity to contain climate change. After all, an international regime to tackle climate cannot be effective without the world’s leading power, largest economy, second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and largest historic emitter.\n",
      "U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement would be taken by other countries as going far beyond the notion that the United States intends to recalibrate elements of its foreign policy, to urge NATO allies to contribute more to their own defense, to review the fairness of various trade arrangements, and so on. It would be taken as something between an incomprehensible punch in the face and the announcement of divorce proceedings.\n",

      "Though Trump has said the wall will cost $12 billion dollars, other estimates have put it closer to $300 billion dollars.\n",
      "In many places the proposed wall would have to be located within U.S. territory. In these spots, migrants would just need to make it to the wall to enter U.S. territory and gain eligibility for asylum. This is already a problem with existing border fencing.\n",
      "The narrative that President Trump has developed around the wall is jeopardizing decades of improvement—fostered by George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama—to the U.S.-Mexican relationship. This threatens many domains of North American integration and cooperation.\n",
      "The wall also poses a threat to wildlife. The border is home to numerous endangered species such as jaguars, pronghorns, tortoises, and frogs whose habitats would be compromised, as well as other wildlife like bees whose pollination patterns would be disrupted.\n",

      "Smugglers will likely circumvent the wall by flying drugs by drones, by airplanes, or by putting them will in trucks hidden among legal goods.\n",
      "Boats will also likely be used to transport drugs and migrants.\n",

      "The Trump administration has declared war on the American press. It has also declared war on the judiciary, also on the Democratic leadership of Congress, sometimes even on the Republican leadership of Congress. But it is the press, or the media, to use its more fashionable moniker, that is the target of the president’s special fury.\n",
      "The press, overall, he says, is a “disgrace,…false, horrible, fake reporting.” It is “out of control…fantastic.” Reporters are “very dishonest people,” their coverage he describes as “an outrage.” The New York Times—a “failing” newspaper. CNN—“terrible.” Buzzfeed—“Garbage.” Then, on top of it all, this presidential tweet, dripping with anger and threat:\n",

      "The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!\n",

      "In case, somehow, you did not get the full impact of this message, his Darth Vader shadow, Stephen Bannon, said that the media ought to be “embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while.”\t\n",

      "Oops! What have we here? Is Trump simply Richard Nixon reborn with a populist message? No. Nixon never thought of himself as God’s gift to the Oval Office; he was a political professional who twisted the law, lied to cover his crime, recognized reality, and resigned in disgrace. Can we now expect Donald Trump to do the same? Should his current problems mushroom into a full-blown crisis? No. Quite the contrary, Trump is a self-absorbed, ego-driven, former reality TV president, narcissistic in many ways, obsessed with cable news (for him, the fount of all knowledge, where, in the words of one columnist, “every issue, every minute, is momentous, every hiccup is a crisis, and every criticism of him is a calumny.”) Trump is an outsider, a real estate magnate, who has never, before now, held political office, never served in the military, and yet managed, in a totally unpredictable presidential campaign, the closest to political madness in recent history, to diminish and demolish 16 other GOP candidates and then, against all odds, it seemed, his favored democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, leaving the experts in politics, journalism, and diplomacy shaking their heads in utter bewilderment.\n",
      "“What hath God wrought?” they might now be asking, fearfully anticipating what’s next for America.\n",
      "[T]here is a vast difference between campaigning, when winning an election defines success, and governing, when balancing competing interests at home and abroad defines success.\n",
      "Donald Trump, the unlikeliest of presidents in a line running back to George Washington, is now arguably the most powerful politician in the world. Already, consistent with his campaign vows and intertwined with Bannon’s odd visions of an onrushing global apocalypse, he has rushed to transform domestic politics and to frighten the world. If, on any given morning, even before breakfast, he pinches himself, and asks, “Is this real? Is it my finger that is on the nuclear button? Am I really president?,” the answer is yes! Let us hope the president understands, as quickly as possible, that there is a vast difference between campaigning, when winning an election defines success, and governing, when balancing competing interests at home and abroad defines success. As best we can judge it, so soon after his inauguration, Donald Trump’s unorthodox presidency represents a new political ballgame in this country.\n",
      "Imagine for a moment two teams. One depends only on its rookie pitcher, the one with the wicked curve ball, wild enough to hit a few batters, yet cocky, utterly convinced he has the right stuff to win what he sees as the final inning of the final game of a bitterly fought world series. The other team has a more traditional strategy, dating back almost 250 years. It depends not only on good pitching but also on reliable hitting and solid defense. It depends, in other words, on a triangular democratic distribution of civic responsibility. With President Trump in the White House, the evidence strongly suggests that this concept is now in doubt. The democratic underpinning of our society, on which we have always based our hopes and dreams, is in jeopardy.\n",
      "“Trumpery,” a term in increasing use, represents a style of governance utterly unfamiliar to the American experience. Creeping, or galloping, authoritarianism may be another term. If there is an explanation for this sudden and disturbing flipflop in American politics, it may lie in the way Trump and his colleagues view media coverage of the presidential campaign that brought them to power. Kellyanne Conway, the president’s ubiquitous spokesperson, who has a ready explanation for anything Trump has ever said or done, claims her boss, during the campaign, was the most “vilified and attacked politician” ever, subject to horrible, “negative coverage.” The press, she says, “suspended the objective standards of journalism,” putting “their finger on the scales” to favor Clinton. They were “unfair,” she goes on, using one of the president’s favorite words. For these reasons, she concludes, Trump has had to fight back, hard. He returns to this theme time and again.\n",
      "The unfortunate, but unavoidable, result—the ongoing war between the president and the press.\n",
      "A humble, abbreviated dissent is now in order. When Trump described the Mexicans as “rapists,” the press reported his comment, accurately. When Trump was caught on tape using what he later called “locker room talk” about female private parts, the press reported it, accurately. When Trump, as president, boasted that more people showed up at his inauguration than did at Barack Obama’s, the press reported it, accurately, before adding, that it was not true.\n",
      "The coverage of Trump, while far from ideal, conveyed essentially an accurate portrayal of the candidate who has now become president. This coverage could be described as negative, but then the fault, dear Brutus, lies with the president, with his words, his actions, his policies, and not with the press, for reporting them.\n",

      "The president, who sees himself as a herald of truth, rarely needing to admit a mistake, or a lie, naturally, when challenged, doubles-down. He describes facts that are unflattering to him as “fake news.” Likewise, polls that show him as the most unpopular president to enter the Oval Office—he calls those polls “fake polls.” In other words, in his judgment, news can only be judged to be truthful and reliable if it describes him in positive, flattering terms. Over the years, any number of autocrats have felt essentially the same way.\n",
      "One of Trump’s surrogates, Scottie Nell Hughes, defended the president’s claim that millions of votes had been cast illegally—three to five million, he said. When his statement was challenged as untrue, she said people now have their own way of interpreting whether a fact is true or not. “There’s no such thing, unfortunately, anymore as facts,” she asserted, contradicting the long-established wisdom of the late Senator Pat Moynihan who said you can have your own opinions, but not your own facts. Apparently, the White House assumes, in this “post-fact” world, that the public does not really care if the president lies. They’ll pick and choose whatever “alternative facts” conform to their political views.\n",
      "“Alternative facts,” by the way, is a Conway concoction.\n",
      "In this upside-down world, Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and Breitbart, which Bannon once ran, provide facts for conservatives, and the Times, the Post, and other outlets provide them for liberals—essentially an absurd but popular notion. This notion shatters a guiding principle of American journalism, which, in theory, at least, once stood for the idea that a news outlet neither supports nor opposes a president. Rather it covers the news impartially, fairly, and objectively.\n",
      "As Adolph Ochs said in 1896, when he purchased The New York Times, he wanted “to give the news impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of party, sect or interests involved.” Trump does not buy this Times formula; he claims most news coverage is biased against him, and this justifies his war against the press. He adds, angrily, that the media is nothing more than an “opposition party,” a kind of political party opposed to his administration.\n",
      "When President Trump blasts the so-called mainstream media, an almost daily eruption, he clearly is playing to his gallery of supporters—they too hate the media. But his goal is broader and more sinister than that—he seeks to humiliate journalists, to belittle them, to discourage their criticism, to emasculate the “fourth branch of government,” as it was once called, to rob it of the legitimacy it used to enjoy among many Americans. Why? So that, at the end of the day, the president can govern as he wishes, without the judiciary to impose legal constraints and without the media to raise embarrassing questions or to criticize his policies, his family business operations, which scream out for a diligent investigation, and his strange willingness to look the other way when an autocrat like Putin takes aggressive action.\n",
      "George Orwell’s “1984” has returned to the best seller lists, readers wanting again to appreciate how a make-believe world works. Remember, in this classic, there is a daily mandatory ritual, called “Two Minutes of Hate,” during which time the people turn their anger against the government’s critics, whoever they may be at the moment.\n",
      "In these troubling times, another classic has jumped back to the best-seller lists—Sinclair Lewis’s 1936 satirical novel, “It Can’t Happen Here.” It focuses on a firebrand demagogue, named Berzelius Windrip, often compared to Trump, who defies the odds and wins the White House. He creates his own facts and his own truth.\n",
      "President Trump is his own Windrip. He depends almost entirely on tweets and cable TV news to spring new policies on the public and to engage in what he calls “my running war” with the media. This can sometimes be tricky. The other day, he claimed Sweden had suffered a terrorist attack, information he got from Fox News, his source. But it wasn’t true. At his recent news conference, he said he got more electoral votes than any one since Ronald Reagan. But that wasn’t true either.\n",
      "A virile, unafraid press is the best guarantor of a free society.\n",
      "The big question of our time, in my judgment, is whether the media, in its daily tussle with an impatient, powerful president has the spunk, the stuff, and the public support, to stand up and say, this far but no further. If the media, for whatever reason, fails to meet this challenge, democracy, as we have known it, will slowly wither away. A virile, unafraid press is the best guarantor of a free society. Weaken the press, and you weaken freedom, and open the door to autocracy.\n",
      "Let me try to explain.\n",
      "Checks and Balances\n",
      "The press in America has never been as strong as the president, who represents the most powerful of the three branches of government. In fact, until the penny press came to define the business in the 1830s and 40s, newspapers were often spokesmen for political parties. That’s how they got their readers and their money. During the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln, no less, imprisoned reporters he said were jeopardizing the war effort. Between Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, as America blossomed at the turn of the 20th century, newspapers grew into a big business, exerting meaningful influence on domestic and foreign policy. During World War I, news organizations began to operate—and, equally important, began to think of themselves—as independent actors, and so did the politicians and presidents they covered.\n",
      "Somewhere between the first and second world wars, the modern era of journalism was born.\n",
      "Central to that era was the ideal of objectivity, which is so difficult to define. That did not mean, as scholar David Greenberg notes, that values and even bias were then washed into oblivion. It did mean that objectivity became an ideal, a goal, a set of broadly accepted standards that governed daily journalism, whether the newspaper, radio, or television station, was in Los Angeles or D.C. The Supreme Court gradually strengthened the independence of journalism in American society, just the way our founding fathers envisaged “freedom of the press” in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution—freedom of the press along with freedom of religion, of speech, of the right peaceably to assemble and petition their government for a redress of grievances. That was how crucially important freedom of the press was to them, and should be to us. Leaders such as Washington and Jefferson, Adams and Madison, at the time of the American Revolution, feared most of all the temptation of politicians to become autocrats if the pressure of governance became too great. They deliberately imposed checks and balances to contain political ambition, one of which was a free and, if necessary, rambunctious press.\n",
      "In a reporter’s quest for fairness, he or she often tends to balance the good against the bad, thereby risking the creation of a false symmetry or balance.\n",
      "My late CBS colleague, Eric Sevareid, once said, “Our rigid formula of so-called objectivity have given the lie the same prominence and impact that truth is given; they have elevated the influence of fools to that of wise men; the ignorant to the level of the learned; the evil to the level of the good.” In a reporter’s quest for fairness, he or she often tends to balance the good against the bad, thereby risking the creation of a false symmetry or balance.\n",
      "There have been other problems, too. During Nixon’s time, in the early 1970’s, the media was targeted as “nattering nabobs of negativism.” I, for one, was put on an “enemy’s list.” My phone was tapped, my office broken into. Nixon even wanted me tailed when I covered the Paris peace talks in 1968, but J. Edgar Hoover, of all people, killed the idea, claiming it would be too expensive.\n",
      "Still, in Nixon’s effort, as the National Press Club put it, “to control, restrict, ..and discredit the press,” he ran into the buzz saw of a Watergate inquiry, inspired by the old-fashioned legwork of two journalists, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, which ultimately exposed Nixon’s sins and persuaded him to resign.\n",
      "Twenty years later, in the mid-1990s, when FOX and MSNBC joined CNN in the expanding world of cable news, when the measure of success in journalism migrated from news for the public good to news for owners’ profit margins, when the internet became everyone’s best friend, things dramatically changed. What used to make money for newspapers, namely ads, shifted to the web. Newspaper profits tanked, and many papers went out of business. Even radio and TV news suffered, as financial pressure and technological change obliged journalism to cut its sails, meaning, among other things, to shrink the number of foreign bureaus and obliterate coverage of middle America, where Trump won big, by the way, and stick basically to coverage of East and West Coast events, plus terrorism and the wars in the Middle East.\n",
      "In this revolutionary period, journalism lost much of its former Watergate glamor.  No longer was it the dashing outsider, Robin Hood, fighting the bad guys for the benefit of the good guys; now, it joined the political wars, or seemed to, conservative outlets favoring Republicans; mainstream outlets the Democrats.\n",
      "For example, in 2016, according to the respected Tyndall Report, the three TV news networks—ABC, CBS, and NBC—helped elect Trump, giving him 1,144 minutes of free coverage compared to 506 minutes for Clinton, more than double the time. On cable news, even more so, with candidate Trump seen and heard anywhere and at any time. The upshot—cable news made more money in 2016 than ever before. Trump was treated as the star of American television. He was often his own TV producer, deciding when and how he would appear, and the networks almost always obliged.\n",
      "During the campaign and since, Trump has been their meal ticket, attracting the attention of friend and foe alike.\n",
      "One would imagine that President Trump would have extended an olive branch to the media—it was so instrumental in his victory; but instead he has declared war on the media, the “opposition party,” as he puts it. Sadly the president seems to want, and need, enemies, someone or some group to blame if and when his presidency runs into serious trouble. Part of his problem, in this respect, is that the media does not really want to meet him on the battlefield.  It does not want to fight a war; it wants simply to do its job, to cover the president of the United States, which is an essential responsibility for any news organization.\n",
      "A few days ago, one prominent editor recalled Bannon’s blast that the media “shut up” and “listen” for a while. He said, we will not shut up. We will stand up, and we will report the news. We will listen, as Bannon requests, but when we hear something newsworthy, we intend to report it, whether he likes it or not. That’s our job, and we intend to do it.\n",
      "It isn’t always easy. Here is one example: Ten days ago, on February 6, TIME magazine featured Bannon on its cover with the headline “The Great Manipulator.” And, on MSNBC, Joe Scarborough showed a clip from “Saturday Night Live,” in which Bannon, dressed as a skeleton in a black cloak, takes over Trump’s desk in the Oval Office and orders the president to a smaller desk, prompting Scarborough to say, “I don’t know. Maybe Bannon is calling the shots.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This is said between 6 and 7 in the morning. The president, a fan of “Morning Joe,” the popular Scarborough talk show, must have been watching, as he normally does every morning at dawn, because at exactly 7:09 on the same morning, he shoots a tweet to his faithful millions that says:\n",
      "\n",
      "I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!\n",
      "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017\n",
      "To cover this president, good reporters know, by now, that they have to get up early and stay up late. They have to watch what Trump watches on cable news—that is his world, his reality. He does not read books, and is restless during intelligence briefings. He operates mostly on instinct. It is suggested by some editors that reporters keep careful notes on Trump’s fuselage of tweets. These are clues to his thinking at any given moment. They could change at any given moment. He is erratic. And when reporters get a chance at a rare news conference to ask a question, make it simple, direct, and be prepared to challenge whatever Trump chooses to say in response. But, under no circumstances, lose your cool. Always act and be the professional.\n",
      "It may be too dramatic to say that American democracy rests in the hands of a free, though at the moment uncertain, press. But I believe it does. I believe that the press, and therefore American democracy, will prevail in time.\n",
      "President Trump is an enormously powerful politician. He hates the press, but can’t seem to live without it.\n",
      "How can I be so sure? I’m not really. President Trump is an enormously powerful politician. He hates the press, but can’t seem to live without it. It’s his oxygen; it keeps him alive, emotionally and politically.\n",
      "By their work, every day, every minute of every day, reporters bring the world to us. They deserve our praise and admiration. We depend on them. Young women cover wars in the Middle East, and often they are stringers without any insurance, subject to kidnapping and death. That’s courage.\n",
      "Resourceful organizations, such as the Pulitzer Center, where I currently hang my hat, help fill the hole left by budgetary shortfalls for foreign coverage. The center gives money to reporters to cover important events all over the world. Last August, for example, helping reporter Scott Anderson fill an entire New York Times Magazine with extraordinary coverage of the Middle East.\n",

      "At Dominican University, a small Catholic school near Chicago, a professor, enchanted by the good things journalism does on a daily basis, inspires his honors students to enter this often-criticized craft, and they do, believing it to be honorable, necessary work—as it is. And there are so many other examples of good, valuable journalism on the rise.\n",
      "President Trump would have been wise to make nice to the press, but I fear he may not be capable of that. Recently, a Post columnist speculated that Trump would not survive four years in the White House. She thinks he will leave after two. Maybe. I then found an interview that Howard Stern, the shock jock, as he’s called, did recently. It was published in The New Yorker a week ago. It said that Stern, who has interviewed Trump many times and knows him quite well, advised his friend not to run for office. “This is something that is going to be very detrimental to his mental health,” Stern said. “He (Trump) wants to be liked, he wants to be loved, he wants people to cheer for him.” Stern added, after noting that criticism of President Trump has been mounting steadily, “I don’t think this is going to be a healthy experience for him.”\n",
      "Whether it is or not, the battle between Trump and the media continues. Let us remember, Trump, eventually, will be gone, whether in four years or eight. We do have election laws, and this is a nation built on law, not on personal privilege. The press will still be here, the essential pillar of our democracy, carved into the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as valid today as it was yesterday or the day before. A free press, if supported by the public, can still perform miracles.\n",

The low value of China’s currency against the U.S. Dollar today is the result of market forces, not government intervention, as was the case a decade ago. Competition from China did cause some “job loss” in America, but technological change (e.g. robots) is the main reason.\n",

      "Second, when we talk about “One China” we are really talking about Taiwan. All the evidence strongly indicates that the people of Taiwan have absolutely no desire to be bargaining chip in a high-stakes negotiation between Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping. Before Trump goes down that road, he owes it to Taiwanese leaders to consult with them to verify whether they wish to be used in this way (my prediction: they will say no).\n",
      "Third, the assumption of Trump’s brinksmanship is that the Chinese side is bluffing and will back down if the United States takes a tough line. But what if that assumption is wrong? On some issues, of course, China does bluff. But on Taiwan, there are reasons it will hold firm. Taiwan has a special place in how Chinese (not just the government) think about their country. The government regards the One China Policy as the keystone in the U.S.-China relationship. For them, removing the keystone leads the whole edifice to crumble. Finally, based on what we know of Xi Jinping’s personality, he doesn’t bluff.\n",

    "Create an ROC curve for this logistic regression and give a personal opinion (backed up by the curve and its sensitivity/recall) about how good the logistic regression is. What would you recommend as a score threshold for the best prediction as to 'whether a player will win the game or not'?\n",

    "<b>B.</b> The problem in part A is a subtle variation on a more traditional logistic regression problem. If two players both have scores of $20,000 at the end of the first round, the statistics indicate that they are both likely to win. However, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcLjcSloXs\" target=\"_blank\">there can be only one</a>. Does looking at the differences in player scores improve your ability to make a definitive statement about the game? (\"Yes that person will definitely win\" or \"It's anyone's game\")\n"
